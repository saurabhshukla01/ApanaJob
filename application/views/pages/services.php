               A job description is an internal document that clearly states the essential job requirements, job duties, job responsibilities, and skills required to perform a specific role. A more detailed job description will cover how success is measured in the role so it can be used during performance evaluations.
            </p>
            <p>
               Properly written job position descriptions are often the only documents that totally define what a role is, what skills are required to perform it, and where the role fits in an organization. This makes it simple to identify candidates that are a good fit for the role and also to hold candidates accountable if they are not performing essential duties that are required in the role.
            </p>
            <p>
               A job specification could be considered a more precise job description that details the exact educational degrees, experience, skills, and requirements for a role. In most cases, these terms are used interchangeably and nearly always describe the same document.
            </p>
            <p>
               Make sure the title of the job position and description match. Do your research. If you're not familiar with the job, talk to someone who is and have them help with the description. Make sure it clearly defines the goals of the position and a timeline for reaching them.
            </p>
            <p>
               Our job descriptions contain the most common job duties list for each position. This should help you get your description written really quickly, although you may need to add job duty or job responsibility information that's specific to your position.
            </p>
            <p>
               Generally these are the same thing. In some regions or countries role description is more common, but most of the United States uses job description.
